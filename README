TazBug - The SliTaz Bug Tracker
================================================================================


The SliTaz Project has setup and tried several bug trackers but they were never
adopted by the main developers. This is an attempt to change that by providing
a radically simple tool well integrated with the SliTaz packages Cooker, Cookiso,
Roadmap and other sites such as the wiki and forum.

Users data are securely stored outside of the web server document root. Passwords
are encrypted with MD5 and also stored outside of the document root.

TazBug is simple to use, 2 types of status exist: OPEN and CLOSED and 2 priority
levels are handled. Affected packages names can be added to the bug and all
bug configuration files can be edited.


TazBug Goals
------------

	* Simple to use with a clean and modern interface
	* Use http://paste.slitaz.org/ for attaching files
	* Use shared accounts with other sites to have only one login


Accounts
--------
To create an account on SliTaz Bugs you can use the web interface


Installation
------------
TazBug should work on any SliTaz system and can be used as a Bug Tracker for
your project. You can grab latest sources from SliTaz Mercurial repositories or
a release tarball from SliTaz mirrors. You need a web server with CGI support
and SliTaz httphelper in /usr/lib/slitaz as well as Busybox HTTPd applet.

People config files: /var/lib/slitaz/people
Auth file with pass: /var/lib/slitaz/auth/people


Development
------------
Shell scripts as usual, HTML 5, CSS 3 and a bit of Javascript. To work on bugs
locally you have to clone the repo, create a vhost for the web interface and
modify tazbug.conf to match your installation. You must also edit /etc/hosts
to add your vhost.
