TazBug - The SliTaz Bug Tracker
================================================================================


The SliTaz Project have setup and tried several bug trackers but ther wher never
adopted by the main developers. This is an attemp to change that by providong
a radicaly simple tool well integrated wirh SliTaz packages Cooker, Cookiso,
Roadmap and other sites such as the wiki and forum.

Users data are securely stored outside of the web server document root. Password
are crypted with MD5 and also stored outside of the document root. Your ID key
is the MD5 sum of your login, mail and password

TazBug is simple to use, 2 type of status exist: OPEN and CLOSED and 4 priority
level are handled. Affected packages name can be added to the bug and the all
bug configuration file can be edited.


TazBug Goals
------------

	* Simple to use with a clean and modern interface
	* Client side cmdline tool to post bugs and messages
	* Full desktop integration with GTK boxes or local CGI script
	* Use http://paste.slitaz.org/ for attached files
	* Use shared accounts with other sites to have only one login


Installation
------------
TazBug should work on any SliTaz system and can be used as a Bug Tracker for
your project. You can grab last source from SliTaz Mercurial repositories or
a release tarball from SliTaz mirrors. You need a web server with CGI support
and SliTaz httphelp in /usr/lib/slitaz as well as Busybox HTTPd applet.

People config files: /var/lib/slitaz/people
Auth file with pass: /var/lib/slitaz/auth/people


Developement
------------
Shell scripts as usual, HTML 5, CSS 3 and a bit of Javascript. To work on bugs
locally you have to clone the repo, create a vhost for the web interface and
modify tazbug.conf to match your installation. You must also edit /etc/hosts
to add your vhost.
