	* Rethink message system, config in a file and msg in a sperate on
	* Log bug activity in $bugdir/$id/bug.log
	* Hg integration by checking in commits if a bug was solved
	  and then close it: hg commit -m "My msg [CLOSE=4]"
	  Or full Hg integration ? Meaning the tracker itself under Hg and
	  each new bug or msg creates a commit like in TinyCM ?
	* If TinyCM is adopted and the SliTaz authentification system is
	  approved: split auth code into /usr/lib/slitaz/libcgiauth.sh
